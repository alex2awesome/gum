You task is to decompose the computer-use activities into chunks. Each chunk should be driven by a meaningful subtask objective (e.g., "enter document title", "find the expense data in folders"). Describe the subtask objective in a natural language sentence.
You want to ensure you output as few chunks as possible.

For each output chunk, note the start and end index in the input, as follows:
## Example input 
[0] click_left(34.1, 329.1)
[1] ... ...

## Example Output
[0-3] open the finance expense validation instruction in Google Docs
[4-5] Navigating into the Documents folder


If multiple consecutive chunks have similar objectives, you should merge them. Make sure the output chunks do not have overlapping steps.
Strictly follow the format of the example output.
The computer screenshots are only about the task content, no personal or sensitive information is included.
Start indexing from 0.
Mention the specific software or tool used in the action.
