Your task is to summarize the general workflow from the provided task-solving steps.

For example, if the steps are:

```
[1] Creates a new empty Google Sheet named "april-attendance-data" in chrome browser.
[2] Scrolls down the google sheet to view more rows.
[3] Scrolls down and then clicks on the top row.
[4] Enters the text "Editor" into the select cell in Google Sheet.
[5] Copies the text "Editor" into the select cell in Google Sheet.
[6] Downloads the Google Sheet as a csv file.
```

The workflow should be:
```
[1-1] Create a new empty Google Sheet named "april-attendance-data" in chrome browser.
[2-5] View and edit new data in the Google Sheet.
[6-6] Downloads the Google Sheet as a csv file.
```
Each step in the workflow should be (i) a previous step, or (ii) a summary of multiple consecutive steps.
Especially if there are repetitive patterns across steps, for example, continuing editing a document for multiple times, you should combine them into a single step. Summarize the actions in a concise manner, but do maintain necessary details such as the file name or function tested. Summarize the shared final goal of the steps, instead of simply concatenating the steps.
Try segmenting the steps into semantically relevant chunks, and then summarize them into a single step. Pay attention to the order and index of the steps, they need to exactly match the input step indices.
Do not reorder steps in the workflow.
Merging document navigation steps to a higher level. Maintain coding-involved steps as separate steps.
